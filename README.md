# Time Series and Forecasting Course Repository  

This repository contains assignments, quizzes, and exams for my **Time Series and Forecasting** course.  

## About Time Series and Forecasting  
Time series analysis involves examining data points collected over time to identify trends, seasonal patterns, and other temporal dynamics. Forecasting builds on this analysis to predict future values. Key topics in this course include:  
- **Time Series Components**: Trends, seasonality, cyclicality, and irregular variations.  
- **Modeling Techniques**: ARIMA, exponential smoothing, and other statistical models.  
- **Forecast Evaluation**: Assessing the accuracy of predictions using metrics like RMSE and MAE.  
- **Applications**: Real-world forecasting for finance, economics, and other domains.  

## Repository Contents  
- **Assignments**: Practical exercises applying time series techniques to datasets.  
- **Quizzes**: Tests of theoretical understanding and analytical skills.  
- **Exams**: Comprehensive assessments of time series modeling and forecasting expertise.  

This repository reflects my journey in mastering time series analysis and building reliable forecasting models.
